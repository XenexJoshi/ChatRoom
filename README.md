ChatRoom:

This program includes a multi-user chat web application that allows users to connect to a common chatroom and share messages among each other. The program is created using C# and SignalR
to create the backend server, and HTML, Javascript, and CSS to create the frontend client-side of the application.

To run the program, the user must have dotnet CLI installed on their device. Navigate to the backend file named ChatRoom and run the following program:

    dotnet run

To run the web application, simply run the index.html file in the ChatRoom.frontend file.
